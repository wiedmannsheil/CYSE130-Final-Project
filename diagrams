Explanation of Each Component

    Cybersecurity Automation (Main System)
        Role: The main system that manages all other components.
        Responsibilities:
            Calls and coordinates all subcomponents: log analysis, system monitoring, alert generation, network traffic monitoring, and security automation.
            Ensures seamless data flow between subcomponents.

    Log Analysis
        Attributes:
            system_log: The input log file to be analyzed.
            summary_report: The output file containing suspicious log entries.
        Methods:
            readLog(): Reads the log file line by line.
            analyzeLog(): Identifies suspicious entries (like "failed" or "unauthorized").
            createReport(): Writes a report with details of suspicious activity.

    System Monitoring
        Attributes:
            CPU Usage: Tracks CPU usage in real-time.
            Memory Usage: Tracks memory usage in real-time.
        Methods:
            monitorCPU(): Monitors CPU usage and logs it.
            monitorRAM(): Monitors memory usage and logs it.
            logData(): Writes the performance log to a file.

    Alert Generation
        Attributes:
            sender_email: The email address from which alerts are sent.
            recipient_email: The email address to which alerts are sent.
        Methods:
            sendAlert(): Sends an email alert when suspicious activity is detected.
            formatEmail(): Formats the email body and subject for easy reading.

    Security Automation
        Attributes:
            Target IP: The IP address to scan.
            Open Ports: List of detected open ports from the Nmap scan.
        Methods:
            runNmapScan(): Executes an Nmap scan on the target IP.
            saveResults(): Writes the Nmap scan results to a file.

    Network Traffic Monitoring
        Attributes:
            Source IP: The source IP of captured network traffic.
            Destination IP: The destination IP of captured network traffic.
        Methods:
            monitorTraffic(): Captures network packets.
            logPackets(): Writes the source and destination IPs to a file.
